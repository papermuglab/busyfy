A Simple Gulp.js Boilerplate
======

I love the way Rails compiles Coffeescript, Scss, and JS, and I sought out to recreate that with a task runner. Gulp made that easy.

### Getting Started

First, clone the repo, then run
~~~
npm install
~~~


Then, to start compiling, just run
~~~
gulp
~~~

That's it!

### The details

Non-compiled Scss goes in `assets/stylesheets/`. These must be Scss.

Non-compiled Coffeescript goes in `assets/coffeescripts/`. These must be Coffeescript.

If you chose to use JS & Coffeescript, or are including libraries in JS, they go in `assets/javascripts/`. Here live the compiled Coffeescript files. They get linted an concatenated from here.

All compiled assets go to `dist/`. This includes a non-minified JS file, and a minified one. This also includes whatever Scss files in `assets/stylesheets/`. I recommend keeping a `main.scss` file that uses `@import` to import Scss partials (instead of having multiple Scss files).

It also has Livereload. Install the Chrome Extention here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en
